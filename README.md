Introduction
Fundamental Requirements
Delivery Format

1. Introduction
You have to develop a graphical application using the C++ programming language that allows you to configure vehicles and to store this information in a class and based on this stored information display the final result.

The application should allow the configuration of the following elements:
Name of the vehicle
Number of wheels 
Power of the engine
Type of fuel
Color: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green
Spare wheel or repair kit
Bubble for kids
Multiple horns
Huge cup holder
License Plate: this one should be generated in a random way pressing a button. It should be made of 4 numbers from 0000 to 9999 and followed by 3 letters. Vowels cannot be used in the license plate.
The app should decide if the vehicle is a motorbike a car or the car of homer, taking in account the chosen configuration and then it should display the result.
Once the vehicle is created and configurated the user should be allowed to create a new one. All the vehicles should be stored. The user will have a graphical interface that will inform him about the number of vehicles created.


2. Considerations
You have to use different graphic elements such as labels, text fields, buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, etc.
You have to use classes
You have to split as much as you can the graphical interface from the logic part of the system
